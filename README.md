# group-08

A Python-based project with a GUI that accepts a photo and feeds it to a multi- threaded turtlesim bot in a ROS simulation that maps the contour of the given input image and then commands a hardware-implemented 4-wheeled droid built using a raspberry pi microprocessor that draws the contour as a sketch on a piece of canvas.
